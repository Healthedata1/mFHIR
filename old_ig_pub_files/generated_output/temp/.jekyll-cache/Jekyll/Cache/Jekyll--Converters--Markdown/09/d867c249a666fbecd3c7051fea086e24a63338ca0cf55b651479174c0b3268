<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The patient determined by e.g., <a href="http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus/#!/calculate/estimate/">http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus/#!/calculate/estimate/</a> to be at moderate CV risk based on blood pressure, BMI, diet and exercise, blood glucose. Patient has a primary care physician (PCP). PCP and the patient jointly decide on improving exercise to meet AHA/WHO/CDC guidelines of150 minutes of moderate exercise (3-6 METS) every week, which they have refined into a mutually agreed upon step goal of 4000 steps daily. PCP prescribes the collection of steps using an mHealth device, to track daily steps and average daily and weekly steps. The patient is given an Open mHealth-compliant/supported consumer device (e.g., FitBit, GoogleFit, Misfit) by the clinic, or the patient already has an Open mHealth-compliant/supported device.</p>

<p>At the next scheduled visit (e.g., in 90 days), the PCP and patient will jointly review during a clinic visit the daily step count and daily and weekly averages in the past 90 days vs the goal of 4000 daily steps. They will do this using a FHIR app that presents the data graphically within the EHR session.</p>
