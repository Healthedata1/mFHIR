Additional information such &quot;released&quot;, &quot;signed&quot;, etc would be represented using [Provenance](provenance.html) which provides not only the act but also the actors and dates and other related data. These act states would be associated with an observation status of `preliminary` until they are all completed and then a status of `final` would be applied.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-observation-status.html#observation-status-entered-in-error">entered-in-error</a></td><td>Entered in Error</td><td>The observation has been withdrawn following previous final release.  This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-world decisions were based on it. (If real-world activity has occurred, the status should be &quot;cancelled&quot; rather than &quot;entered-in-error&quot;.).</td></tr></table></li></ul></div></body>
