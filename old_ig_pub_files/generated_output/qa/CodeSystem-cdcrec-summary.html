 <tr><td>Definition:</td><td><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has prepared a code set for use in codingrace and ethnicity data. This code set is based on current federal standards for classifying data onrace and ethnicity, specifically the minimum race and ethnicity categories defined by the U.S. Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) and a more detailed set of race and ethnicity categories maintainedby the U.S. Bureau of the Census (BC). The main purpose of the code set is to facilitate use of federalstandards for classifying data on race and ethnicity when these data are exchanged, stored, retrieved,or analyzed in electronic form. At the same time, the code set can be applied to paper-based recordsystems to the extent that these systems are used to collect, maintain, and report data on race andethnicity in accordance with current federal standards.
