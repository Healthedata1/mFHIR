### Description

The patient determined by e.g., <http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus/#!/calculate/estimate/> to be at moderate CV risk based on blood pressure, BMI, diet and exercise, blood glucose. Patient has a primary care physician (PCP). PCP and the patient jointly decide on improving exercise to meet AHA/WHO/CDC guidelines of150 minutes of moderate exercise (3-6 METS) every week, which they have refined into a mutually agreed upon step goal of 4000 steps daily. PCP prescribes the collection of steps using an mHealth device, to track daily steps and average daily and weekly steps. The patient is given an Open mHealth-compliant/supported consumer device (e.g., FitBit, GoogleFit, Misfit) by the clinic, or the patient already has an Open mHealth-compliant/supported device.


At the next scheduled visit (e.g., in 90 days), the PCP and patient will jointly review during a clinic visit the daily step count and daily and weekly averages in the past 90 days vs the goal of 4000 daily steps. They will do this using a FHIR app that presents the data graphically within the EHR session.

#### Actors


1. Patient
1. Primary care physician (PCP)
1. FHIR-enabled**  ** EHR
1. a mHealth data server (called ** R24 Server**  in this use case) with FHIR server running SMART-on-FHIR protocols for authentication/authorization, etc.
1. Patient's step counter sensor (called ** StepSensor**  in this use case) -- specific product, may be the patient's phone
1. Data store for the Step-Counter Device output (e.g., cloud and/or phone (e.g., GoogleFit, HealthKit)) that either offers data directly in Open mHealth format using an Open mHealth endpoint, or is supported by Shimmer
1. FHIR app (called ** mDATA**  in this use case) -- has roles for PCP, onboarding staff, and patient


#### Assumptions, Pre-Conditions and Constraints

1. Is one way data flow, PCP initiates the pull of data into the EHR session (i.e., PCP launches FHIR app).
1. No data is being written to the EHR.
1. The mDATA FHIR app supports user roles of PCP, onboarding staff, and patient. mDATA has Shimmer in it. mDATA has access to the following EHR data about the patient
1.  email
1. cell phone #
1. patient portal credentials
1. PCP has authorization to mDATA
1. Data that is presented in mDATA FHIR app is not persisted in the FHIR app, but could be.
1. EHR is FHIR-enabled, with security/access provisions in place that allows FHIR apps to
1. read data from an external data source (e.g., R24 server)
1. read EHR data into the app to provide clinical context (patient ID/name, weight)
1. Patient is known to provider and has an EHR record and a unique MRN
1. EHR may or may not have a patient portal. Patient may or may not already have patient portal credentials.
1. Patient has a smartphone that can run a web or native FHIR app
1. R24 has security/access provisions in place
1. R24 server makes a copy of the data from StepSensor and persists that data in a data store (OMOP in this use case)
1. This use case describes the collection of only a single data variable (step count) from a single device (StepSensor)
1. No real-time or threshold or triggered alerts

### Basic Flow

#### Order step count and set up StepSensor
