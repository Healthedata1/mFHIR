Hi Eric,
as per our conversation yesterday I am resending you the links to the metadata schemas on the IEEE site
the datapoint schema is the same as in OMH
the schema-od schema has a minor change (one less property than the one in OMH)
the header schemas has a number of changes from the OMH version
the data series schema is new in IEEE (not in OMH)
Please, let me know if you have any questions on the schemas

m resending the original email and adding a couple of direct links:
